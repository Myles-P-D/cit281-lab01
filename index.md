# CIT 281 lab 01

## Outcome: 

This lab was focused mainly on using the command line and downloading software that would be used for the rest of the class.    
Personally the command line is a quite daunting when first looking at the terminal but I quickly learned it was nothing to fear.    
I gained expereince using the command line to create directorieds as well as files locally on my macbook.    
At this point I was not comfortable with the commands and had to write them on a stickynote in order to quickly refrence and eventually commit them to memory.

**[Here](https://github.com/Myles-P-D/cit281-lab01/blob/main/lab-01-node.js)** is a link to the code below that was ran using node.js.  

```javascript
function square(num)
{
    return num*num; 
}
console.log('Square operations:')
for (let i = 2; i <= 10; i+=2)
{
    console.log(`Square of ${i} is ${square(i)}`);
}
```
