# CIT 281 lab 01

## Outcome: 

This lab was focused mainly on using the command line and downloading software that would be used for the rest of the class.    
Personally the command line is a quite daunting when first looking at the terminal but I quickly learned it was nothing to fear.    
I gained expereince using the command line to create directorieds as well as files locally on my macbook.    
At this point I was not comfortable with the commands and had to write them on a stickynote in order to quickly refrence and eventually commit them to memory.
